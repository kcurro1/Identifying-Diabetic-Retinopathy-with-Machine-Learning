# Identifying Diabetic Retinopathy with Machine Learning

## Project Description
Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among individuals with diabetes. Early detection is crucial in preventing the progression of this condition, as symptoms often do not appear until the disease has reached an advanced stage. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans. The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy, enable early intervention, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.
